<html><head></head><body><div class="description"><p>For this activity, you will create a professional online portfolio to showcase your research, instructional designs and prototypes, and other professional activities throughout graduate school. This will be invaluable in marketing yourself for jobs and internships so put a good effort into making it as nice as you can. Many of you may not yet have strong web development skills, so focus on having a clean and well-organized site, even if you use something like Google Sites or Weebly to create it. Also, focus on creating quality documents that can then be easily inserted into a revised website in the future when you DO have the web development skills. If you are new to web development, I think WordPress, Weebly, or Wix can help you create a nice looking portfolio. Your online portfolio should include sections for:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a blog or a place for you to reflect on issues in the field</li>
	<li>any research and writing you do (including the class paper you write)</li>
	<li>design and development examples</li>
	<li>work experience</li>
	<li>education experience</li>
	<li>connections to Mendeley, LinkedIn, and other social networking links you wish to share.</li>
	<li>a personal teaching philosophy and evidence of your teaching experience, if you have any.</li>
	<li>Anything else you can add to "sell" yourself for the kind of work you want to do!</li>
</ul>

<p>Just for your information, other professors will ask you to add to your portfolio as you go throughout your program, which is why we create it now in Foundations, just as you are beginning!</p>

To inform your work, I recommend reading this article on creating a digital identity. It's geared towards academics, but applicable to others as well. -&nbsp;<a href="https://goo.gl/MEq67s">https://goo.gl/MEq67s</a></p>

<p>On this page I have some example online portfolios. Some haven't been updated regularly, unfortunately. I picked on purpose a wide variety to show you many different styles -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.byuipt.net/rickwest/for-students/">http://www.byuipt.net/rickwest/for-students/</a></p>

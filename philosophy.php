		<p>Education has the power to shape the lives of learners. Whether it’s K-12, higher learning, informal learning, or corporate training, education helps learners to rise to a higher plane, to grow nearer to reaching their full potential. Education is a vehicle for enlightenment and freedom, where learners can discover truths about the world around them and the complex beauty that lies within themselves as individuals. Instructors seek to help learners to develop their natural talents, to discover their interests, to develop skills that are practical and applicable to daily life, and to make meaningful contributions to society. To reach these worthy ends, we must continue to study and understand how to make teaching more effective and how to better help learners through the learning process.</p>
		<p>
		Learning is deeply complex, because people are deeply complex. Psychology and the social sciences try to explain and simplify human motivation, emotion, thought, and behavior. The ideas and theories that these sciences produce help us to better understand people in general, but can never be completely sufficient, because each individual is too complex to be completely defined by a set of psychological theories. That being said, there are certain principles and theories regarding teaching and learning that I prescribe to, not because I believe they are an end-all-be-all, but because they provide a foundation that is flexible and adaptable for individual teachers and learners.

		<h3>Solving Real-world Problems</h3>
		<p>
		Education strives to help learners gain the skills they need to thrive in the real world. Merrill states as one of his five first principles of instruction that “learning is promoted when learners are engaged in solving real-world problems” (2002). Much of the research that has been done in cognitive psychology supports that learners learn better when engaged in solving problems (Mayer, 1992). Problem-based learning (PBL) and activity theory are two of the many learning theories and sciences that emphasize the importance of helping learners work together to solve real-life problems to prepare learners for the real world.
		</p>
		<p>
		Problem-based learning is a learner-centered approach in which learners are responsible for their own learning. For ideal PBL instruction, the instructor defines an ill-structured problem that integrates knowledge from multiple disciplines and requires collaboration between learners. The problem must be ill-structured to mirror real-world problems and to allow for free inquiry (Savery, 2006). People solving real-world problems often need to recall and apply information integrated from diverse sources in their work, so PBL problems should similarly integrate knowledge from a wide range of disciplines. PBL acknowledges that “collaboration is essential” because once learners are out of school, most “will find themselves in jobs where they need to share information and work productively with others” (Savery, 2006). In PBL, the instructor guides the learners through four levels of instruction: (1) the problem, (2) the tasks required to solve the problem, (3) the operations that comprise the tasks, and (4) the actions that comprise the operations. As the instructor gradually increases the complexity of the problems, learners’ skills gradually improve until they can master a complex problem (Merrill, 2002).
		</p>
		<p>
		Activity theory is similar to problem-based learning, but has some key differences. Activity theory focuses learners on a transformative problem; the instructor defines an object that the learners act on to transform it. The instructor helps the learners to model a community, divides the labor amongst learners, provides tools, and defines rules to give structure to the activity. Activity theory puts a greater emphasis on collaboration than PBL does; learners are assessed according to how well they work as a group to transform the object rather than how well they perform individually. Activity theory states that classrooms should not be a place where individual learners are separated from their environment to develop individual talents, but should be a place where learners have fully contextualized experiences interacting with their environment and with other learners (Barab &amp; Plucker, 2002).
		</p>
		<p>
		These learning theories emphasize helping learners collaborate together to solve real problems. Instead of teaching facts that learners memorize and regurgitate, instructors teach principles in the context of realistic problems. With modern technology, learners have quick access to facts—they do not need to memorize facts as much as they need to know how to work in a group to apply learning in the context of a real-world problem. Bloom’s taxonomy (1956) places application of knowledge as a higher educational outcome than mere recognition and recall, because it is the application of knowledge that will prepare learners for the real world.

		<h3>Technology and Learning</h3>
		<p>
		My educational background is in computer science. Although I do not believe that everybody should be a computer scientist, I do believe that one of the purposes of modern education should be to help learners understand computing and coding well enough that they can be masters over their technology instead of their technology having mastery over them. Regardless of the learner’s life goals and career goals, the ability to use computers and to understand how computers fundamentally work will benefit the learner. Thus, technology integration is an important element of modern education. One particular learning science that I am interested in is computer-supported collaborative learning.
		</p>
		<p>
		Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL), simply put, is “studying how people can learn together with the help of computers” (Stahl, Koschmann, &amp; Suthers, 2006). CSCL was started in the 1990s in response to educational software that encouraged learners to use in isolation. The goal of CSCL is to use technology to enhance social interactions between learners instead of isolating them from each other. Computers provide a medium of communication that can enhance face-to-face communication or can connect learners from over great distances. Participants learn from collaborating with each other: they can ask questions, pursue lines of inquiry, teach each other, and observe how others are learning. The software is designed to help learners solve problems as a social group, which in turn leads to individual learning. Thus, learners are assessed both at the level of the group unit and at the individual level.
		</p>
		<p>
		CSCL teaches learners how to use technology without reducing social interaction. It shows learners that technology can be used to enhance social interaction. Like problem-based learning and activity theory, CSCL focuses on helping learners to work through real-world problems as a team, where individuals support each other and learn from each other.
		</p>
		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p>
		Learning is complex, but learning theories can help provide a framework to help instructors teach more effectively to help improve learning. Education should aim to help learners learn skills to solve complex real-world problems through collaboration with peers and through the appropriate use of technology.

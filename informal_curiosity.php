		The Museum of Natural Curiosity at Thanksgiving Point operates on the principle that play and exploration lead to learning. The museum’s curators subscribe to Rossett and Hoffman’s philosophy that “perhaps the most important role for museums … is that of promoting the love of learning itself” (2012, p. 175). Instead of simply presenting textual and pictorial information to patrons, the exhibits are designed to encourage patrons to explore and to construct their own understanding. Play naturally leads to curiosity, which in turn promotes creative inquiry, which leads to understanding.

		After being admitted to the museum, patrons have to cross a bridge—a metaphor for leaving the real world behind. This design helps patrons to see that the rules that apply in the real world (e.g., “don’t get dirty,” “don’t climb on things,” “don’t touch that”) no longer apply as they are free to explore this new world they have stepped into. The patrons find themselves in a central hub with pathways into five different areas of the museum: the rainforest, waterworks, the innovation gallery, Kidopolis and the discovery garden. From the patron’s perspective the experience is unstructured, but the environment is a product of careful design processes (Rossett & Hoffman, 2012, p. 173).  The design is intentionally nonlinear, giving no prescribed order in which patrons have to visit the exhibits. Patrons are free to explore in whatever order they choose, thus designing their own unique adventure with each visit to the museum. Museums, if they are to succeed, must attract and hold their participants (Rossett & Hoffman, 2012, p. 170), and this principle of free exploration keeps patrons engaged and motivated to create their own learning (Merrill, 2002, p. 50).

		Of the five areas, Kidopolis is the area that I found most insightful as I was observing. Kidopolis is designed to look like a small city. It includes a farm, a bank, a music studio, a film production studio, a play house, an animal hospital, a laundromat, an art studio, a dance studio, and a construction area. It is an area that inspires creative inquiry, community, and artistic expression. As patrons spend time creating art, music, dance, and film, they develop understanding and skills that they can take from the museum and apply into the real world (Merrill, 2002, p. 51).

		As I observed the music room, there were no adults, just kids exploring music by themselves. The doors are heavy and thick as to be nearly sound-proof, allowing the kids to explore without interfering with the play of others. Some of the kids just spent a minute or two tinkering with the interfaces that control the rhythm, tempo, and melody of the music. Some others prodded randomly at the controls and danced wildly to whatever sounds were produced. Yet others spent quite a long time exploring on their own, carefully tweaking all of the settings until they had discovered the perfect song for themselves at that time. In all cases, learning occurred (arguably to various degrees) as the kids participated in the process of creation.

		In some situations, kids seemed to learn a lot more when adults were involved in their play. In the art studio (and other areas throughout the museum that had art supplies), I noticed that older kids generally could spend a long time working on a single work of art unsupervised, whereas younger kids would not spend a long time creating art unless an adult was helping them. Younger kids without adult help seemed to get bored or frustrated very quickly. Perhaps this is related to Vygotsky’s proposal that when a child is learning a new skill, he or she can perform better if helped by an expert (1978), and perhaps the better performance produced greater motivation. Or, perhaps it was the social element of creating art with somebody else that made the activity more compelling and more rewarding. In any case, those who had adult help seemed to stay engaged and enjoy the process a lot more.
		</p>

		There were some situations where adults seemed to inhibit the play (and therefore the learning) of kids. One thing that I noticed on multiple occasions throughout the museum is that adults had a greater tendency to separate and discretize the spaces. For example, a child took a stuffed dog from the animal hospital and put it in a doghouse that he had made out of blocks in the construction area. Once the child’s mother noticed what he was doing, she told him to put the dog back because it belonged in the animal hospital. In another case, a small group of children was playing cops and robbers using the bank as a prison cell, props from the film studio, and costumes from the play house. Kids had a greater tendency to form a cohesive narrative using elements from all over the museum, whereas adults (who perhaps were unsure about the museum’s rules and felt the need to keep things organized) had a greater tendency to view each area as its own discrete space.
		</p>
		<p>
		Overall, the museum seems very well-designed to promote learning and exploration. Kids and adults alike can play, explore, and create new things, leading to strengthened relationships and a greater understanding of the world.

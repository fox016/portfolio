		What is Instructional Psychology and Technology?
		</h3>
		<p>
		When I tell people that I have a bachelor’s degree in computer science, they generally recognize what that means right away. They might not understand all of the nuances that separate computer science from related fields like software engineering or information technology, but they typically have a basic understanding of what a computer scientist does. When I tell people that I’m pursuing a master’s degree in instructional psychology and technology, they often respond with blank stares or confused expressions. They ask me questions about what topics the field covers, what are its practical applications, and what I intend on doing with such a degree. It is those questions that I wish to answer here.

		<h3>
		A Brief History
		</h3>
		<p>
		Instructional psychology and technology “encompasses the analysis of learning and performance problems, and the design, development, implementation, evaluation and management of instructional and non-instructional processes and resources intended to improve learning and performance in a variety of settings” (Reiser, 2001, p. 53). Wagner (2011) defined instructional design as both “the systematic development of instructional specifications using learning and instructional theory to ensure the quality of instruction” and “the science of creating detailed specifications for the development, implementation, evaluation, and maintenance of situations that facilitate the learning of both large and small units of subject matter at all levels of complexity” (p. 34). Simply put, it is the study and implementation of how technology and principles of psychology can be used to improve instruction and learning generally. I am going to separate the history of the field into two parts: a history of instructional technology and a history of instructional psychology.

		History of Instructional Technology
		</h3>
		<p>
		In the 1920s and 1930s, educational researchers explored how technology such as motion pictures and radio could contribute to learning. The Department of Visual Instruction (DVI) was formed, and a number of textbooks about instructional media were published. At the onset of World War II, the need to efficiently train masses of military personnel resulted in the creation of hundreds of training films and filmstrips. Corporations also began using film to prepare civilians to work in industry. After the war, the increased birth rate led to a rise in public school attendance, which forced schools to adapt. Public schools began to adopt the use of media to upgrade their curriculum. Instructional television gained momentum in the 1950s, but lost momentum in the mid-1960s, partly due to mediocre instructional quality (Reiser, 2001, p. 58). In the 1960s and 1970s, IBM developed computer-assisted instruction (CAI) programs to be used in schools, but such CAI programs turned out to have little impact on education (Pagliaro, 1983). The 1980s brought micro-computers into public education, and since then, rapid developments in technology (e.g., the World Wide Web, laptops, Wi-Fi, smartphones, tablets) have generated great interest in how to effectively use these new media in instruction and learning.

		History of Instructional Psychology
		</h3>
		<p>
		Some of the early professionals who designed and produced instructional media referred to the work of early psychologists such as Watson and Thorndike. However, it was not until psychologist Skinner’s development of teaching machines and programmed learning in 1954 that educational media professionals felt they had a strong psychological base (AECT, 2001, paragraph 7). In the 1960s, psychologists such as Jerome Bruner and Robert Glaser introduced concepts behind cognitive psychology to the field. These principles were expounded upon in the 1980s when Robert Gagné used them to define learning processes and methods for designing instruction. Since then, psychologists and educators have continued to study and research theories about how instructors can teach more effectively and how students can learn more effectively.

		<h3>
		The Field Today
		</h3>
		<p>
		Today, instructional psychology and technology professionals study a wide variety of fields: “Today’s working IDs [instructional designers] are technical writers, screen writers, video producers, project managers, budget managers, evaluators, graphic artists, graphic designers, experience designers, interface designers, web designers, content authors, scripters, coders, [and] analysts” (Wagner, 2011, p. 35). They research topics in fields such as K-12 formal education, higher education, social learning, corporate training, online learning, second language acquisition, project management, product design, and informal learning.

		My background in computer science drew me into the field of instructional psychology and technology. I am interested in studying how computer science instructors could better teach students of all ages how to code without overwhelming or intimidating the students. My background in computer science has given me a mastery over the content, but it has not helped me to become a master teacher of that content. Instructional design and technology will help me to understand how students learn and how instructors can teach more effectively so that I can better design instruction to effectively help others develop the love for and understanding of computers that I have.

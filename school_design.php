		My high school incorporates ideas from problem-based instruction, social constructivism, blended learning, and flipped classroom instruction.
		</p>
		<p>
		At my high school, Monday through Thursday are classroom days. Students have 4 classes on Mon/Wed and 4 more on Tues/Thurs. Of the 8 classes, one needs to be English, one needs to be a foreign language class, one needs to be STEM related, one needs to be related to health/fitness/exercise, and one needs to be related to music or visual arts. The other three are electives.
		</p>
		<p>
		All classes have online components in the school’s LMS. The LMS contains all reading assignments and other instructional media for the course. All instructional media is interactive in that students will have to answer questions while they read or watch the instruction. The path the instruction takes depends on how students perform on these micro assessments: If the student’s answers reflect an understanding of the content, the instruction will continue, otherwise the instruction will dive deeper into the content that the student seems to be struggling with. Students get credit for reading by making it through all the required material and scoring 100% on the final reading assessment. If the student fails to score 100% on the final reading assessment, the instruction will help the student until the student can score 100%, or the student can choose to accept less credit for a lesser score. The LMS will also provide tools for communication and collaboration between students. Students will be provided with laptops (if needed) so that they can do the reading assignments and micro assessments at home, freeing up class time to focus on the application of the knowledge gained. This flipped classroom approach “represents a unique combination of learning theories once thought to be incompatible—active, problem-based learning activities founded upon a constructivist ideology and instructional lectures derived from direct instruction methods founded upon behaviorist principles” (Bishop, J. &amp; Verleger, M., 2013).
		</p>
		<p>
		The LMS also contains an assignment tree for each course. Students submit their assignments via the LMS, which then either auto-grades (if possible) or awaits instructor grading. Once the student passes off an assignment, that assignment’s children nodes in the assignment tree become available for the student to work on. Each class defines a minimum pace at which students should make their way down the assignment tree, but nothing will prevent driven students from getting ahead. “All students work at their own maximum pace to reach mastery in each attainment. This individualized, customized, and self-paced learning process allows the school district to realize high standards for its students” (Watson, S. &amp; Reigeluth, C., 2008). This solves the current problem where “faster learners are bored to frustration and waste much valuable time waiting for the group to move on—a considerable squander of talent that our communities, companies, and society sorely need” (Reigeluth, C., 2011).
		</p>

		Class time is mostly dedicated to helping students work on the assignments that are currently available to them in the assignment tree. Instructors may choose to devote a brief portion of classroom time to a lecture or discussion on the reading and assignments that students going at the minimum pace should be at. Students who are ahead on assignments can ignore these discussions and spend that time working on whatever assignments are available to them. For the rest of class time, students work on their assignments and instructors help answer students’ questions as they come up.
		</p>

		Each of these Monday through Thursday courses are divided up into sections. For example, a coding class may be divided up into (1) the basics, (2) using mathematical formulae, (3) string manipulation, (4) functional programming, (5) iteration, (6) object-oriented programming, (7) file I/O, (8) persistent data, (9) recursion, and (10) data structures. Each assignment in the course is assigned to one or more of these sections, and the student received a grade for each section rather than receiving a grade for the class as a whole. A struggling student can then choose to slow down and just focus on the first five sections of a course, then can retake the course the next semester and focus on the next sections. This prevents problems regarding students who are forced to move on with the rest of the class regardless of whether or not they have learned the material, which can lead many students to accumulate learning deficits and eventually drop out (Watson, S. &amp; Reigeluth, C., 2008).

		Fridays are interdisciplinary collaboration days, or problem-based days. Each Friday, students are put into groups (or divide themselves into groups, should they be driven so to do) to collaborate together to work on a solution to an ill-defined problem. The problem should be interdisciplinary and open-ended to allow for student creativity in coming up with a solution. Instructors walk amongst the groups, answering questions and providing scaffolding where needed. Each student in the school receives a collaboration grade, which is based on how much the student participates, how well the student works with others, how creative the student’s solutions are, and how effectively the student’s solutions solve the given problems.

		Parents play a big role in the flipped classroom paradigm. Because the student is first exposed to new learning material at home away from instructors, parents may need to help their children to explore the new material and to understand the reading assignments. Parents have to learn and embrace their roles in their children’s education if their children are to be successful.
		</p>
		<p>
		Because this is a charter school, it will get no business if parents are not convinced that these learning paradigms are the best for their children. Thus, advertising to parents in the community is key to the successful adoption of the school. The school will strive to be involved in the community by performing service projects and hosting community events. The school will also publish monthly newsletters to be sent out to community members who are interested in learning more about the school and what goes on within it. The school will have a well-designed website that allows community members to quickly find information or answers to any questions they may have. The school will constantly evaluate its methods, publish the findings, and make incremental improvements.
